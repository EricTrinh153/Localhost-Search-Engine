# Localhost Search Engine (Ruby on Rails)
- This project is to build a search engine for the file's term which the term is the input from the user
- The user can search the term that is existed in any files in the input directory
- If the term is existed, the context of the file and the file name will be shown on the display area
- If the term is not existed, the application will require the user for typing in again for the another search
